## COVID Statement
For the safety of all students, faculty, and staff on campus, it is important for each of us to be mindful of safety measures that have been put in place for our protection. By returning to campus, you have acknowledged your responsibility for protecting the collective health of our community.  Your participation in this course on an in-person basis is conditional upon your adherence to all safety measures mandated by the State of Michigan and the University, including maintaining physical distancing of six feet from others, and properly wearing a face covering in class.  Other applicable safety measures may be described in the [Wolverine Culture of Care](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/uploads/Wolverine_Culture_of_Care%20sign_8.5x11_UPDATED_071520.pdf) and the [Universityâ€™s Face Covering Policy for COVID-19](http://ehs.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/U-M-Face-Covering-Policy-for-COVID-19.pdf).  Your ability to participate in this course in-person as well as your grade may be impacted by failure to comply with campus safety measures.  Individuals seeking to request an accommodation related to the face covering requirement under the Americans with Disabilities Act should contact the [Office for Institutional Equity](https://oie.umich.edu/american-with-disabilities-act-ada/).  If you are unable or unwilling to adhere to these safety measures while in a face-to-face class setting, you will be required to participate on a remote basis (if available) or to disenroll from the class.  I also encourage you to review the [Statement of Students Rights and Responsibilities](https://oscr.umich.edu/statement), which includes a [COVID-related Statement Addendum](https://oscr.umich.edu/sites/oscr.umich.edu/files/2020_statement_addendum_final_approved.pdf).

## Student Mental Health and Wellbeing

If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available. For help, contact Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at (734) 764-8312 and https://caps.umich.edu/ during and after hours, on weekends and holidays.
