## COVID Statement
For the safety of all students, faculty, and staff on campus, it is important for each of us to be mindful of safety measures that have been put in place for our protection. By returning to campus, you have acknowledged your responsibility for protecting the collective health of our community.  Your participation in this course on an in-person basis is conditional upon your adherence to all safety measures mandated by the State of Michigan and the University, including maintaining physical distancing of six feet from others, and properly wearing a face covering in class.  Other applicable safety measures may be described in the [Wolverine Culture of Care](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/uploads/Wolverine_Culture_of_Care%20sign_8.5x11_UPDATED_071520.pdf) and the [University’s Face Covering Policy for COVID-19](http://ehs.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/U-M-Face-Covering-Policy-for-COVID-19.pdf).  Your ability to participate in this course in-person as well as your grade may be impacted by failure to comply with campus safety measures.  Individuals seeking to request an accommodation related to the face covering requirement under the Americans with Disabilities Act should contact the [Office for Institutional Equity](https://oie.umich.edu/american-with-disabilities-act-ada/).  If you are unable or unwilling to adhere to these safety measures while in a face-to-face class setting, you will be required to participate on a remote basis (if available) or to disenroll from the class.  I also encourage you to review the [Statement of Students Rights and Responsibilities](https://oscr.umich.edu/statement), which includes a [COVID-related Statement Addendum](https://oscr.umich.edu/sites/oscr.umich.edu/files/2020_statement_addendum_final_approved.pdf).

## Student Mental Health and Wellbeing
The University of Michigan is committed to advancing the mental health and wellbeing of its students. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available. For help, contact Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at (734) 764-8312 and https://caps.umich.edu/ during and after hours, on weekends and holidays. You may also consult University Health Service (UHS) at (734) 764-8320 and https://www.uhs.umich.edu/mentalhealthsvcs, or for alcohol or drug concerns, see www.uhs.umich.edu/aodresources. Since many students are remote during fall 2020, [CAPS COVID-19 Support](https://caps.umich.edu/topic/caps-covid-19-support) features [SilverCloud](https://caps.umich.edu/silvercloud), an online, self-guided, interactive mental health resource that provides cognitive behavioral interventions.For a listing of other mental health resources available on and off campus, visit: http://umich.edu/~mhealth/

## Academic Integrity
Unless otherwise specified in an assignment all submitted work must be your own, original work. Any excerpts, statements, or phrases from the work of others must be clearly identified as a quotation, and a proper citation provided. Any violation of the School’s policy on Academic and Professional Integrity (stated in the Bachelor's, Master’s and Doctoral Student Handbooks) will result in serious penalties, which might range from failing an assignment, to failing a course, to being expelled from the program. Violations of academic and professional integrity will be reported to UMSI Student Affairs. Consequences impacting assignment or course grades are determined by the faculty instructor; additional sanctions may be imposed by the assistant dean for academic and student affairs.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
If you think you need an accommodation for a disability, please let me know at your earliest convenience. Some aspects of this course, the assignments, the in-class activities, and the way we teach may be modified to facilitate your participation and progress. As soon as you make me aware of your needs, we can work with the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) to help us determine appropriate accommodations. SSD (734-763-3000; http://ssd.umich.edu/) typically recommends accommodations through a Verified Individualized Services and Accommodations (VISA) form. I will treat any information that you provide in as confidential a manner as possible.
